# OpenCV with CUDA support

Some of motion estimation & compensation functions of {mod}`optimap.motion` support GPU-accelerated computing using supported NVIDIA GPUs. They rely on a OpenCV version which was built with CUDA support. 

If you are using Arch/Manjaro Linux prebuilt CUDA versions of OpenCV are available in the AUR: [opencv-cuda](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/opencv-cuda/)
