    "\n",
    "This tutorial introduces the motion compensation capabilities of ``optimap``. Motion in optical mapping studies causes severe measurement artifacts, often referred to as 'motion artifacts' [{footcite:t}`Rohde2005,Christoph2018a, Lebert2022, Kappadan2023, Christoph2023`]. To avoid these artifacts, the vast majority of optical mapping studies are conducted with pharmacological agents, such as Blebbistatin, which suppress the contractile motion of heart tissue by uncoupling the excitation-contraction coupling mechanism [{footcite:t}`Swift2021`]. `optimap` includes numerical methods with which motion artifacts can be substantially reduced. Instead of suppressing motion pharmacologically, we can use ``optimap`` to track, stabilize and inhibit motion and motion artifacts numerically. In many cases, uncoupling agents are no longer needed and optical mapping studies can be performed with freely contracting tissues. \n",

    "This tutorial explains how to process cardiac optical mapping recordings with motion and discusses best practices to reduce motion artifacts using numerical motion tracking. [Tutorial 7](ratiometry.ipynb) discusses an additional optical technique, ratiometric imaging, which can be applied in combination with numerical motion tracking to further reduce motion artifacts, see also {footcite:t}`Kappadan2020`.\n",

    "### Weak Motion\n",
    "\n",
    "Relatively little contractile motion occurs during tachyarrhythmias, such as ventricular fibrillation (VF) in isolated hearts, or in cell cultures. Such small or finite motion promises the highest success rates when trying to compensate motion artifacts using numerical motion tracking. [Tutorial 1](basics.ipynb) already demonstrated numerical motion compensation with ventricular fibrillation (VF), and numerical motion artifact compensation would be similarly succesful with recordings of other rhythms (e.g. sinus or pacing) in which Blebbistatin was not 100% effective. The VF recording was obtained entirely without Blebbistatin. The dominant frequency of the vortex waves is very high (> 10Hz) and, accordingly, the contractile motion is very small. Numerical motion compensation works very well under these circumstances provided the video quality is sufficiently high. In this VF example, motion artifacts are very strong without numerical motion compensation despite the minimal motion, see below. After numerical motion compensation, it is possible to normalize the data, visualize waves, calculate phase maps, see [Tutorial 9](phase.ipynb), and calculate dominant frequencies. The following lines of code load the VF example file from our website [cardiacvision.ucsf.edu](https://cardiacvision.ucsf.edu), perform the motion compensation and display the result:"

    "With reference frame 40 the compensated video is completely motion-stabilized and we could proceed with post-processing. However, with reference frame 0 the compensated video exhibits warping artifacts. This is because the motion is much larger from frame 0 all the way to the end of the video than from one of the frames halfway through the video (particularly in this example, overall this is not always an issue). With reference frame 0 the tracking algorithm was not able to establish a spatial correlation with all frames. With sinus rhythm or pacing it is usually good practice to pick a reference frame during diastoly shortly before the depolarization phase or application of a pacing stimuli, as this frame shows the tissue in a relaxed, uncontracted state (relevant when computing tissue strain or contraction). However, depending on the magnitude of translational and/or rotational motion and deformation it might be required to pay attention to whether the camera can see the tissue throughout the entire sequence of frames. Selecting a different reference frame can circumvent issues with the tracking. By contrast, during VF, it is not necessarily required to pick a reference frame, any frame is likely to work as long as the tissue does not move much. A related issue during sinus rhythm is that the heart might rotate during contraction, such that parts of the tracked tissue do not face the camera any longer. Subsequently, only frames in which the tissue is fully visible can be tracked, not the entire video sequence. The latter problem can only be addressed using multi-camera optical mapping systems as in {footcite:t}`Chowdhary2023`.\n",

Videos with very low noise do not require this step, and, in general, the sensitivity to noise depends on the particular tracking algorithm, see {footcite:t}`Lebert2022`). The pre-smoothing can be applied either by specifying `presmooth_spatial=1,presmooth_temporal=1` as input parameters in {func}`motion_compensate`, or by performing {func}`smooth_spatiotemporal` with the same parameters on the original video and then passing the smoothed video to the contrast-enhancement and tracking. The filter kernel size needs to be adapted to the video data, but we recommend small kernel sizes as the smoothing is intended to only suppress high-frequency noise (resulting from the camera). Larger kernel sizes might smooth the video too aggressively, such that important features and image contrast are lost (keep in mind that features and contrast in the image are required for tracking).\n",

Tracking algorithms can inadvertently track the movement of action potential or calcium waves, see Fig. 11B in {footcite:t}`Christoph2018a`.

    "The compensated video on the left without contrast-enhancement exhibits strong warping artifacts. The video at the center exhibits some residual warping artifacts, which are hard to notice but occur when the action potential wave front propagates across the image (the kernel size `contrast_kernel=3` is too small). The video on the right does not exhibit any noticeable residual motion on the ventricular surface (`contrast_kernel=9`). The atria often exhibit residual motion, in particular when they are close to the boundaries of the video image. Note that the original video was not pre-smoothed. If the contrast-enhanced videos are too noisy, even with the optimal kernel size and with pre-smoothing the original raw video, then they should be pre-smoothed as well to minimize noise in the tracking.\n",

    "**When compensated videos do not exhibit any residual motion, the motion compensation was successful**. Vice versa, if they do, then the tracking does not work properly. It is not always immediately obvious whether residual motion is still present in compensated videos, but confirming that they are free of residual motion is the best way to determine whether the tracking accurately tracks/follows the motion. It is best to zoom in and assess the motion visually. Please note that some video players or exported videos compress the motion in the sequence of images and might give the impression that there is residual motion when there is none. `monochrome` is a viewer that displays the raw video pixel by pixel without any interpolation, compression or other adulterations. Alternatively, one could verify that the tracked displacement vectors match the motion of the tissue, see below, but this is also sometimes not easy to verify. Lastly, one can check the amount of residual motion artifacts in the pixel-wise normalized optical maps, see [Fig. 10](https://www.frontiersin.org/files/Articles/366834/fphys-09-01483-HTML/image_m/fphys-09-01483-g010.jpg) in {footcite:t}`Christoph2018a`.\n",
