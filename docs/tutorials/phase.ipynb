    "# Tutorial 7: Phase and Singularities during VF\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will learn how to compute phase maps of action potential vortex waves during ventricular fibrillation (VF). Using the phase maps, we will compute and track phase singularities across the epicardial surface of an isolated intact rabbit heart during VF. Phase singularities (PS) indicate rotational core regions of reentrant vortex waves (spiral waves) and can be used to characterize the complexity of VF or interactions of reentrant waves with tissue. For example, a higher number of PS can indicate more aggresive episodes of VF, moving PS are associated with meandering spiral waves, and PS can attach to scar tissue. `optimap` provides all routines which are necessary to compute phase videos from raw optical mapping videos, filter phase videos and calculate and track phase singularities. Similar analysis was performed in {footcite:t}`Christoph2018,Lebert2021` among many other publications.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the example file from [Tutorial 1](basics.ipynb) and first compensate the residual contractile motion to work with a video without motion. Alternatively, you could use one of your own recordings obtained with a motion-uncoupled heart pharmacologically arrested with Blebbistatin. The following lines of code load the raw video and compute a pixel-wise normalized motion-stabilized video:"
