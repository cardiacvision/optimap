    "# Tutorial 9: Phase and Singularities during VF\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will learn how to compute phase maps of action potential vortex waves during ventricular fibrillation (VF). Using the phase maps, we will compute and track phase singularities across the epicardial surface of an isolated intact rabbit heart during VF. Phase singularities (PS) indicate rotational core regions of reentrant vortex waves (spiral waves) and can be used to characterize the complexity of VF or to document interactions of reentrant waves with the substrate. For example, a higher number of PS can indicate more aggresive episodes of VF, moving PS are associated with meandering spiral waves and high motility, and PS can attach to scar tissue and other heterogeneities. `optimap` provides all routines which are necessary to compute and filter phase videos, and calculate and track phase singularities. Similar analysis was performed in {footcite:t}`Christoph2018,Lebert2021` among many other publications.\n",
