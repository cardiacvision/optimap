    "\n",
    "This tutorial will cover the measurement of fluorescent signals and wave dynamics from cardiac optical mapping data more generally. In [Tutorial 1](basics.ipynb) we already loaded and displayed video data, performed numerical motion tracking and motion-stabilization, performed some post-processing, and displayed action potential waves. In this tutorial, we will cover the post-processing routines used to extract and display the optical signals in more detail. We first repeat the steps from the previous tutorial by loading the experimental data and performing motion correction. Note that the motion correction step is not required if you analyze data that was acquired with Blebbistatin or other pharmacological uncoupling or motion-inhibition techniques (you then simply skip this step)."
