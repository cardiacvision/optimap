    "``optimap`` is a package that can be imported and used in Python scripts. [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_programming_language) is a freely available programming language that is also very popular in scientific computing. The simplest way to access the functionality of ``optimap`` is to import it at the beginning of a new Python script as follows:"

If the import produces an error then ``optimap`` was  not installed correctly, see [Installation Guide](#installing) for further details. \n",

Alternatively, you could load your own file by replacing `filepath` with the filename of your video which you have stored somewhere on your computer. After loading, the video corresponds to a three-dimensional `NumPy`-array where the first dimension is time and the other two dimensions are the x- and y-dimensions, respectively. The example file shows a fibrillating, weakly contracting rabbit heart stained with voltage-sensitive dye (Di-4-ANEPPS) imaged using a Basler acA720-520um camera at 500fps. Due to the staining, the action potential wave is inverted, i.e. an upstroke is observed as a negative deflection. The data is from {cite}`Chowdhary2023` and we extracted a short part of the original recording and saved the otherwise unprocessed raw video data as a numpy file (`.npy`).

    "## Visualization of Action Potential Waves\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we stained the heart with the voltage-sensitive fluorescent dye Di-4-ANEPPS. Together with an appropriate bandpass filter, Di-4-ANEPPS produces a slight decrease in the measured fluorescence when the tissue depolarizes. Accordingly, in order to visualize action potential waves, this small optical signal needs to be amplified (numerically). One way to achieve this is to normalize the optical traces 'pixel-wise': each time-series measured in a single pixel is normalized individually. In simple terms, when normalizing an optical trace one divides each value of the time-series by the maximal value found in the entire time-series and subtracts the minimum of the time-series. This removes the baseline of the time-series and all values subsequently fluctuate between 0 and 1. In our case, the depolarized phase of the action potential corresponds to values close to 0 and the diastolic interval to values close to 1. Correspondingly, the action potential wave darkens the video image. `optimap` has several built-in routines, which perform these normalization steps automatically. A more detailed explanation of visualizing action potential or calcium waves with different post-processing and normalization functions is given in [Tutorial 2](signal_extraction.ipynb). \n",

    "We can compute a 'pixel-wise normalized video' using `optimap`'s rolling- or sliding-window normalization function ({func}`video.normalize_pixelwise_slidingwindow`). This function is applied to the motion-stabilized or warped video. We slide a short temporal window over the time-series extracted from this video and perform the normalization sequentially for one value after another with the corresponding local maxima and minima. The `window_size` parameter controls the length of the sliding window, which needs to be adjusted to the period of the action potential or calcium waves. Here, we use a window size of 60 frames (120 ms)."
