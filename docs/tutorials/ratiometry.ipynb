    "## Combining Numerical Motion Compensation and Ratiometry with Di-4-ANEPPS\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will discuss the analysis of ratiometric optical mapping data. Numerical motion tracking and motion-stabilization alone cannot inhibit motion artifacts entirely. The reason is that the relative motion between the tissue and the light sources used to excite the fluorescent dye persists afer numerical motion-stabilization. Motion tracking is merely a change of the frame of reference. Typically, the illumination from the light sources moves across the tissue after motion-stabilization leading to motion artifacts. To achieve better motion artifact compensation, particularly with stronger motion, it is therefore required to combine numerical motion tracking with ratiometric imaging, as described in {cite:t}`Kappadan2020` or in {cite:t}`Zhang2016`. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the example below, the heart was stained with Di-4-ANEPPS and imaged using alternating green and blue illumination at 500fps. More specifically, the tissue was illuminated in every odd frame with green light and in every even frame with blue light, respectively. This approach is sometimess referred to as 'excitation ratiometry'. After numerical motion tracking and stabilization, the green and blue videos are divided by each other to obtain a motion-stabilized ratiometric video. Using this method, both motion artifacts as well as illumination artifacts (which also lead to motion artifacts) can be significantly reduced. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, we load the video data, which is stored as a single file (`Example_05_Ratiometry.npy`) containing the two green and blue videos in an interleaved fashion (frame 1 = green, frame 2 = blue, frame 3 = green, etc.). Using optimap's {func}`load_video()` function, we can specify to load only every 2nd frame and to start reading from the first or the second frame, respectively:"
