Legacy C++ functions, available in Python under `optimap.cpp`. We plan to replace them with pure python code when we have a fast enough implementation.

All required C++ dependencies are included in the `include` folder:

* [xtensor](https://github.com/xtensor-stack/xtensor), version `0.23.1`
* [xtl](https://github.com/xtensor-stack/xtl), version `0.7.2`
* [xtensor-python](https://github.com/xtensor-stack/xtensor-python), version `0.25.1`
